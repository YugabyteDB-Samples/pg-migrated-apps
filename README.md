# pg-migrated-apps

A collection of applications migrated from PostgreSQL to YugabyteDB.

## Prerequisites

1. Join the [YugabyteDB Slack Community](https://communityinviter.com/apps/yugabyte-db/register), head to the [pg-app-century-challenge channel](https://yugabyte-db.slack.com/archives/C07HF8K2KN3), and raise your hand!
2. Fork this repository.
3. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download) or [run in Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).
4. Install [YugabyteDB](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/quick-start/).
   **NOTE: Be sure to run YugabyteDB with the `--enable_pg_parity_tech_preview` flag**
5. Install [YugabyteDB Voyager](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/yugabyte-voyager/install-yb-voyager/).

## Migration Steps

Instructions for migrating and running each application are available and linked in the `Instructions` column of the table below. Unless otherwise stated, follow these steps:

### Run on PostgreSQL

1. Start the application on PostgreSQL.
2. Load sample data.
3. Confirm the application is running properly.

### Perform Offline Migration

Use the `yb-voyager` CLI to [perform an offline migration](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/yugabyte-voyager/migrate/migrate-steps/).

1. Generate and view migration assessment report.
2. Export the schema and data from PostgreSQL.
3. Perform schema analysis and review report.
4. Import the schema and data to YugabyteDB.
5. Verify the migration was successful by running queries to check row counts.
6. Run the application on YugabyteDB.

### After Migration

1. Fill out application instructions in `/apps/APP_NAME.md`
2. Issue a pull request to contribute to this project.
3. Report your status to the [pg-app-century-challenge channel](https://yugabyte-db.slack.com/archives/C07HF8K2KN3).
